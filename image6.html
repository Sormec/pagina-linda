     <p> For this assigment. I decided to do monochromatic. I chose to use circles and colors that would compliment each other. I use the star tool to add on top of the circles and make them a little more applealing to the eye. For the stars I didn't choose the same size because I think that it would look a little boring , so thats why I acted different shapes. For the second assigment I wanted to make it a little simple and use restangles and squares. I chose this colors because I wanted to give it a fun look to it.  </p>
