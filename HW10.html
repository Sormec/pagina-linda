     <p> This is my interactive story. For this story I wanted to have two main characters the thief and the policemen. The thief robbed a jelewy store and gets caught but doesn't know which way to go. There are two options; The stairs or a door to the left that leads him to differect outcomes. I included many different endings so the player can have more fun with it.  </p>
